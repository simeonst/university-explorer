# University Explorer

Full stack web application built to explore Courses and Rooms at UBC, as a part of a term-long project. 

Allows users to find data such as course averages, instructors, departments, pass/fail numbers as well as room locations, seats, types and furniture. Front-end form allows users to input various complex queries, which are then validated, transformed into JSON and used to filter dataset.
